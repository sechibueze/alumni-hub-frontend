# Project Description
> AlumniHub is an online web platform for coordinated action, affirmative voice, shared knowledge, experince & support in the fight against education inequity. We are leveraging the opportunity in technology to share our unique impact, mobilize efforts in th fight against education inequity, inspire donors to support and  keep supporting the work we do

# Objectives
- a structure for alums to continue to share their impact stories
- mentor and inspire fellows in the classroom
- share experience which could be helpful to the fellows/community
- build a knowledge bank/resource of locally focused but globally defined contents to support people committed to fighting inequity
- Share tried and tested methods for classroom impact
- enhance alumni connectivity and networking
- support alumni data management and info sharing/communication
- create a smooth inspiring process for onboarding of fellows into the alumni community
- Create a platform for prospective and intending donors and project sponsors to learn and understand the work we do and its impact in our community
- support social media campagn and publicity efforts of [Teach for Nigeria](https://teachfornigeria.org)

# The Problem
  - impact stories on social media are dispersed and sometimes untrackable if hashtags are mispelt or uncoordinated which is the case in some of the times.
  - We need to be strategic in harnessing the  varied interest and diversified vocation but collective root/vision of our alums in a movement towards ending education inequity.
  - Fellows need coordinated inspiration everyday, an assurance that they are part of a movement, and ultimately to ride on existing experience in scaling their impact in the classroom and community. It is okay to consider that fellows are not alums but we all can attest that successful fellows make great alums.
  - Be the Change project need publicity so fellows can raise funds to execute them - the stories of success of prvious BTCs can do this when coordinated

# The Solution
  - Single source of truth: Provide a coordinated and unified platform for uniting our impact and voice in the fight against education inequity.
  - collective actions, one voice, one movement: impact stories as told by those who made them
  - Provide knowledge, experience, inspiration and support for prospective fellows
  - Support social media campaigns
  - Support fund raising engagements
